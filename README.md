<h1 align="center">SECURE VAULT - THE ONLY KEY IS YOU</h1>

<br>

**Secure Vault** is a privacy-focused application designed to safeguard your passwords, documents, and other confidential information. It's built with end-to-end encryption, ensuring that only you have access to your data. We never have access to your passwords or sensitive information. 

This project is built with full-stack ownership and security-first architecture, combining:

- A responsive **React + Next.js** web app
- A robust **Spring Boot + Java** backend with Redis caching
- JWT-based authentication and OAuth2 support
- Modular codebase structured for future extensibility (e.g., mobile client, multi-device sync)

> üõ†Ô∏è **Status**: Actively in development ‚Äî core features are live, and I‚Äôm continuing to add secure sharing, MFA, vault tagging, and mobile client support.

## ‚öóÔ∏è Key Features:

* **Zero-Knowledge Encryption**: All data is encrypted client-side and remains unreadable even to the server.
* **Master Password Security:** Your master password is the only key to unlocking your vault.
* **Secure Storage:** Keep all your valuable data safe and organized in one place.
* **Internationalization (i18n)**: Designed for global use with localized support.
* **Secure Sharing (In Progress)**: Share vault items safely using time-bound, encrypted share links.
